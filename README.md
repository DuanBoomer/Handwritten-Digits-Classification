# Handwritten Digits Classification using MNIST Dataset
## Neural Network Implementation
The structure of the neural network is as follows -

| Layers	| Input		| Output 	|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Flatten	| (None,28, 28)	| (None, 784)	|
| Dense 	| (None, 784)	| (None, 128)	|
| Dense 	| (None, 128) 	| (None, 10)	|

In words, we turn the input image into a flat vector representation and pass it through a hidden layer of 128 neurons which is connected to the output layer of 10 neurons signifing the 10 digits.

## Training and Evaluation
We use a learning rate of 0.001 with adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross entropy as loss and accuracy as the evaluation metrics. We train the model for 6 epochs with a shuffling of data with each epoch.

We get the following results from training and evaluation -

| 		| Loss 		| Accuracy	|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Training 	| 0.0326 	| 0.9896 	|
| Evaluation 	| 0.0760 	| 0.9768 	|

## Visualization
The visualization is made using Gradio. In it you are able enter digits using your handwriting and see the various probabilities generated by the model for the 10 digits. The code for the visualization is in the notebook.
